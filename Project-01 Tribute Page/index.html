      <h2>Timeline of Gandhi's life:</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever." <cite>-Mahatma Gandhi</cite></p>
      </blockquote>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>1869</strong> - Gandhi was born in Porbandar in West Bengal, India.</li>
          <li><strong>1891</strong> - After attending Inner Temple Law School in the United Kingdom, Gandhi passes the
            bar exam and becomes a lawyer. Unknown to him at the time, his mother has passed away while he is at
            school.</li>
          <li><strong>1893</strong> - Gandhi is thrown off of a train in South Africa for refusing to move from his
            First
            Class seat to Third Class (even though he held a valid First Class ticket). Such discrimination against
            Indians was common practice and this personal experience gives Gandhi resolve to fight racial
            discrimination.</li>
          <li><strong>1894</strong> - Gandhi founds the Natal Indian Congress to oppose a bill denying Indians the
            right
            to vote in South Africa. Although the bill passes, Gandhi successfully focuses a broad range of public
            attention on injustices against Indians even as far away as India and the UK.</li>
          <li><strong>1897</strong> - Landing in Durban Harbor, South Africa, Gandhi is beaten up by a mob of white
            settlers. His life is saved when the wife of the Durban Police Chief stands between Gandhi and his
            attackers.
            Because of media attention to the event, the colonial government is forced to arrest members of the mob but
            Gandhi refuses to press charges. Gandhi gains increased public admiration and support. His attackers offer
            a
            public apology.</li>
          <li><strong>1906</strong> - The South African colonial government enacts the “Asian Population Registration
            Act” where all residents of Asian countries, including India, had to register their name, age, address,
            job,
            and other personal information and carry a card with their finger prints. Gandhi develops his principals of
            non-violent protest “satyagraha” (devotion to the truth or “soul force”).</li>
          <li><strong>1908</strong> - Gandhi and 2,000 fellow Indians in Johannesburg burn their registration cards in
            protest. Even as Gandhi and other leaders are repeatedly arrested over 6 years of protest, non-violent
            rallies continue to grow in size.</li>
          <li><strong>1920</strong> - Gandhi gets people to more intently boycott British products and encourages
            people
            to start making their own clothes rather than buying British clothing.</li>
          <li><strong>1930</strong> - The British retaliate by passing the Salt Act which makes it illegal for Indians
            to
            make their own salt, punishable by at least three years in jail. On March 12th, Gandhi (now 61 years old)
            travels 320 km (200 miles) on foot for 24 days to Dandi to make his own salt. Others follow. Gandhi is
            again
            imprisoned.</li>
          <li><strong>1942</strong> - Gandhi launches the Quit India campaign declaring India’s independence from
            British
            rule. Gandhi is imprisoned.</li>
          <li><strong>1943</strong> - The 73 year old Gandhi starts a hunger strike that lasts for 21 days.</li>
          <li><strong>1944</strong> - Fearful that Gandhi would die in prison due to failing health and become a
            martyr,
            he and other leaders are released.</li>
          <li><strong>1948</strong> - Gandhi is killed by a member of a Hindu organization angered by Gandhi’s
            peacemaking efforts. Gandhi was shot on his way to evening prayers. His memory and teachings live on in the
            non-violent peace movements of today.</li>
